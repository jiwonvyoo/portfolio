        <p>Hello!</p>
        <!-- <p>🌍 Born in <span class="highlight">Seoul, South Korea</span> and raised in <span class="highlight">Bangkok, Thailand</span>, I’ve cultivated a diverse global perspective that shapes both my academic pursuits and personal interests. Currently, I am based in Providence, RI, pursuing a degree in <span class="highlight">Applied Mathematics–Computer Science</span> at <span class="highlight-brown">Brown University</span>.</p>

        <p>🏆 My passion for mathematics began early, earning recognition such as the <strong>Top in the World Award in Mathematics</strong> from Cambridge Outstanding Learners. I’ve also received distinctions in competitions like the <strong>British Mathematics Olympiad</strong> and the <strong>Southeast Asia Mathematics Competition</strong>, and advanced to finalist positions at the <strong>World Mathematics Championships</strong>. At Brown, I continue to deepen my expertise in applied mathematics and its practical intersections with computer science.</p>

        <p>👩🏻‍💻 Building on that foundation, I’m exploring algorithms, data science, and machine learning—where abstract theories come to life through computation. I’m equally passionate about <strong>business strategy and entrepreneurship</strong>, a passion I pursued at <span class="highlight-orange">Hanwha’s Global Finance Internship</span> in the <strong>Entrepreneurship Track</strong>, where I collaborated on a B2C community app.</p>

        <p>🎨 Outside of academics, I’m an avid <strong>problem-solver and creative</strong>. I enjoy tackling logic puzzles, pen drawing, digital art, journaling, and learning new languages. Yet, nothing beats a good late-night conversation with friends!</p> -->
