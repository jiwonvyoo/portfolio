      <p>Hi, I’m <span class="highlight">Jiwon Yoo</span> — a product-minded problem solver with a global upbringing and a deep love for systems thinking.</p>
      <p>🌏 Born in <span class="highlight">Seoul</span> and raised in <span class="highlight-green">Bangkok</span>, I’ve always navigated between cultures, languages, and perspectives. That adaptability now fuels how I approach product strategy: balancing user needs, technical feasibility, and business impact. I’m currently based in <span class="highlight">Providence, RI</span>, studying <span class="highlight">Applied Mathematics–Computer Science</span> at <span class="highlight-brown">Brown University</span>.</p>
      <p>🏆 My journey started with a love for math. I earned the <span class="highlight">Top in the World Award</span> from Cambridge Outstanding Learners, a <span class="highlight-orange">Merit Award</span> from the British Math Olympiad, and finaled at World Mathematics Championship and South East Asia Math Championship. These experiences shaped how I think – analytical, logical and detail oriented.</p>
      <p>👩‍💼 I’m currently diving into product development. At <span class="highlight-orange">Hanwha’s Global Internship Program Entrepreneurship Track in 2024</span>, I co-developed a B2C wellness app. I led product and business development, UX redesigns, scoping MVPs, and asking: <em>How can we design smarter, scale faster, and serve users better?</em></p>
      <p>🧠 As an aspiring future product manager or a consultant, I thrive at the intersection of <span class="highlight">data</span>, <span class="highlight-purple">product</span>, and <span class="highlight-yellow">decision-making</span>. Whether I’m whiteboarding flows, digging into user interviews, or aligning stakeholders, I love turning ambiguity into clarity and ideas into outcomes.</p>
      <p>🎨 Outside of work, I’m a logic puzzle lover, digital artist, and a martial artist (Taekwondo)! I find creativity not in contrast to analytics—but as its perfect partner.</p>
      <p><b>Let’s build something <span class="highlight-orange">thoughtful</span> and <span class="highlight">impactful</span>. Together!</b></p>
