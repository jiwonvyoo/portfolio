    <div class="container">
      <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
      <p>During the summer of 2024, I joined the Hanwha Global Internship Program’s entrepreneurship track—a rigorous and fast-paced experience designed to simulate the startup lifecycle from ideation to pitch. Our cohort brought together students with backgrounds in business, design, and software development. Over eight weeks, our challenge was to create an innovative product that addressed a real-world problem, with the opportunity to present our solution to a panel of venture capitalists.</p>
      <p>This is where Tydes was born: a startup aimed at tackling one of Gen Z’s most prevalent challenges—screen time addiction—through creativity, community, and behavioral design.</p>

      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>Tydes is an iOS productivity app built with Gen Z in mind. Our goal? Help users reclaim their time and refocus their energy on meaningful, offline experiences. By combining gamification, social accountability, and digital wellness features, we created a product that transforms reducing screen time from a chore into a rewarding daily ritual.</p>

      <h2 id="problem">Problem & Mission</h2>
      <p>Today’s Gen Z spends an average of 7 hours and 11 minutes on their smartphones daily. This isn’t just about distraction—it’s about lost opportunities, heightened anxiety, and disrupted well-being. Nearly half of young users admit to being addicted to their phones. But most tools available today either guilt users or fail to stick.</p>
      <p>Our mission with Tydes was to offer a more engaging, positive alternative: an app that doesn’t restrict—but inspires. We focused on three pillars: making the experience fun, interactive, and motivational.</p>

      <h4>Pain Points</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Low engagement:</b> Traditional productivity apps are often boring. We wanted to create something users would look forward to opening.</li>
        <li><b>No real consequences:</b> Most screen-time tools are easy to bypass, which means they’re rarely used consistently.</li>
        <li><b>Missing motivation:</b> Without regular reminders or social reinforcement, it’s easy to lose interest after a few days.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="concept">Concept & Differentiation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Surfer avatars:</strong> Personalized characters that evolve with user progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive animations:</strong> Visual feedback that rewards consistency and playfully calls out failures.</li>
        <li><strong>Gen Z-first tone:</strong> Encouraging, gamified, and non-punitive—a wellness tool that users *want* to engage with.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
        <h4>Community Feed</h4> 
        <div class="equal-height-row">
            <img src="./assets/community.png" alt="Community Feed">
            <img src="./assets/community-detailed.png" alt="Detailed Community Post">
        </div>
        <p>The feed is the social heart of Tydes. Here, users share their daily screen time, top used apps, offline achievements, and even photos from their time spent away from screens. This blend of raw data and personal storytelling helps normalize screen struggles while fostering mutual encouragement. </p>

        <h4>Gamified Timer</h4> 
        <div class="equal-height-row">
            <img src="./assets/timer.png" alt="Timer Screen">
        </div>
        <p>Our timer isn’t just a clock—it’s a surf session. When users activate the timer, their avatar rides a wave. Quit early, and the wave crashes. Complete your focus time? You earn tricks, rewards, and progress points. It’s a playful way to reinforce discipline and celebrate consistency.</p>

        <div class="equal-height-row">
            <img src="./assets/rewards.png" alt="Reward System">
        </div>
        <p>Users unlock gear for their avatars and log offline moments, turning digital restraint into an experience worth sharing.</p>

        <h4>Challenges</h4> 
        <div class="equal-height-row">
            <img src="./assets/challenge.png" alt="Challenge Feature">
        </div>
        <p>We added a financial twist: users can opt into challenges by betting money on meeting their goals. Complete the challenge and earn a bonus; fail, and your contribution funds the winners’ pot. Whether solo or competing with friends, this feature added real-world stakes to digital wellness.</p>

        <h4>My Page</h4> 
        <div class="equal-height-row">
          <img src="./assets/mypage-main.png" alt="My Page 1">
          <img src="./assets/mypage.png" alt="My Page 2">
        </div>        
        <p>“My Page” is where users see their personal story unfold. From screen time trends to reward unlocks and even whimsical stats like how much they could’ve earned working instead of scrolling—it’s a playful, reflective space that makes progress feel tangible.</p>

      <h2 id="business">Business Model</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Freemium:</strong> Premium tier includes advanced stats, custom gear, and expanded challenge participation.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical ads:</strong> Carefully curated ads that promote offline hobbies—like journaling kits, sports gear, or museum memberships.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge pool fees:</strong> Revenue share from bet-based challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Brand partnerships:</strong> Long-term potential for sponsored challenges and wellness campaigns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
      <p>Leading the business and product strategy for Tydes gave me an end-to-end startup experience—from user research to investor pitch. It also pushed me creatively. I designed avatar sets in Illustrator (a tool I was new to) and collaborated with engineers and designers to align our vision.</p>
      <p>What I'm most proud of is how we reframed digital discipline into something joyful and community-led. Tydes isn’t about control—it’s about reclaiming time in a way that feels human.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, biggest shoutout to the Hanwha GIP 2024 Entrepreneurship members, and especially the Tydes team!</p>
